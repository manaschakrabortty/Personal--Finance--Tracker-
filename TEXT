

Project Overview:
Purpose: The project is a financial data management tool designed to help users track and manage their income and expenses. It allows for adding transactions, viewing them within a specified date range, and visualizing the data using plots.
Core Features:
Adding Transactions: Users can add financial transactions, including date, amount, category (Income or Expense), and a description.

Viewing Transactions: Users can view transactions within a specified date range and get a summary of their income, expenses, and net savings.

Plotting Transactions: The project offers a graphical representation of income and expenses over time.

Why I Built This Project:
Personal Finance Management: The project addresses a common need for better personal finance management by simplifying the process of tracking financial data.

Learning Objectives: It also serves as a way to enhance my skills in data handling, Python programming, and data visualization.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Pandas (import pandas as pd):

Why: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It makes handling structured data easy, allowing for efficient data processing, especially with CSV files.

Where: Used in the CSV class to read, filter, and manipulate transaction data stored in the CSV file.
CSV (import csv):
Why: The csv module is used to write new transaction entries directly into the CSV file. It is simple and efficient for handling tabular data.
Where: Used in the add_entry method to append new transactions to the CSV file.

Datetime (from datetime import datetime):
Why: The datetime module is essential for handling dates, especially for parsing user input and filtering transactions by date.
Where: Used throughout the project for date validation, conversion, and filtering of transactions.

Matplotlib (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt):
Why: Matplotlib is a robust library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is used here to generate plots of financial data over time.
Where: Used in the plot_transaction function to plot income and expenses over a specified period.
Line-by-Line Explanation:

Class Initialization (class CSV:):

Purpose: This class manages CSV file operations, including initialization, adding entries, and retrieving transactions.
Initialize CSV (initialize_csv method):

Purpose: Ensures the CSV file exists; if not, it creates one with the required columns.
Add Entry (add_entry method):

Purpose: Adds a new transaction to the CSV file. It takes date, amount, category, and description as inputs.
Get Transactions (get_transactions method):

Purpose: Retrieves transactions within a specified date range, calculates the total income, expenses, and net savings, and displays the data.
Plot Transactions (plot_transaction function):

Purpose: Visualizes the financial data using a line graph to show trends in income and expenses over time.
Data Entry Functions (dataentry.py):

Purpose: These functions handle user input, including validating dates, amounts, and categories, ensuring data integrity.
Common Interview Questions:
Why did you choose to use CSV files instead of a database?

Answer: For simplicity and ease of use, especially given the project's scope. CSV files are easy to manage and sufficient for small-scale data storage.
How would you scale this project?

Answer: By integrating a database (e.g., SQLite, MySQL) to handle larger datasets and possibly a web interface for better user interaction.
Why did you use Matplotlib for visualization?

Answer: Matplotlib is well-suited for creating a wide variety of static plots, and its integration with pandas makes it ideal for visualizing financial data.
What challenges did you face?

Answer: Handling user input validation was crucial to ensure data integrity, and working with date ranges required careful manipulation of datetime objects.
